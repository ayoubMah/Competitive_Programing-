Alice and Bob are standing on a 2D plane. Alice starts at the point (0, 0), and Bob
starts at the point (R, S) (1 <= R, S <= 1000). Every second, Alice moves M units to the
right, and N units up. Every second, Bob moves P units to the left, and Q units down.
(1 <= M, N, P, Q <= 10). Determine if Alice and Bob will ever meet (be at the same point at
the same time), and if so, when.
INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input contains R and S.
The second line of the input contains M, N, P, and Q.
