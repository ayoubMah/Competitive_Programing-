## About
This repository contains problems and solutions from popular competitive programming platforms and contests. Each problem is organized by difficulty and topic, making it easier to navigate and find relevant solutions. Problems cover a variety of domains, including:
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Graph Theory
- Dynamic Programming
- Mathematics
- And more...

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

### Example
- `LeetCode/Two_Sum/solution.cpp`: C++ solution for the Two Sum problem on LeetCode.
- `Codeforces/Problem_1234A/problem.md`: Problem statement and solution for a specific Codeforces problem.

### Directory Breakdown
- **Platform Name**: Folder for each competitive programming platform (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank).
- **Problem Name**: Subfolder for each problem, containing:
  - **problem.md**: Problem statement or a link to the problem.
  - **solution.ext**: Solution file, where `ext` is the file extension for the programming language (e.g., `.cpp`, `.py`).
  - **explanation.md**: (Optional) Explanation of the approach and complexity analysis.

## Problem Sources
Problems are sourced from popular competitive programming platforms:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)

Each problem folder includes a `problem.md` file with either the problem statement or a link to the official problem page.

## Languages and Tools
The solutions in this repository are primarily written in:
- **C++**
